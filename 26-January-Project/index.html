            Not Just an <br />
            Ordinary Story
          </h3>
          <p class="text reveal">
            Republic Day in India, observed on January 26th every year, is a
            celebration that goes beyond the spectacular displays of military
            might and cultural diversity.
            <br />
            The selection of January 26th is deeply symbolic. It serves as a
            bridge connecting India's past, present, and future. The day
            embodies the spirit of the 'Purna Swaraj' declaration and signifies
            a continuity from the struggle for independence to the establishment
            of a democratic and sovereign republic. The symbolism is a testament
            to the enduring values that guided India's journey into nationhood.
